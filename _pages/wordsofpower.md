Words of power are sounds that cause objects to be manipulated in some way.
They require the user to speak them aloud and in the correct order to manifest an effect.

Collect the lexicon of power, and put parts together to produce an effect.

For instance, there are words for: 

SELF, TOUCH, CHANNEL, RANGE, MASS

As well as words that mean the following: 

DROP:

FREEZE:
FEAR:
PAIN:
SLEEP: 
HEAL: - there is no heal? 

BREAK: 
DISINTEGRATE: 

ANIMATE: 

DOMINATE: 

If you had the words for Touch and Sleep, you could combine them to make anyone you touched fall asleep. NB: SELF  + DISINTEGRATE is a bad idea.

Psychic Backlash: 
It should be noted that each word that is used cause the speaker to take some damage.

Some words are more harmful to the speaker than others and generally the further away from you the target is the more harmful it is, and the more powerful the effect the more harm it does the speaker.

If SELF + DISINTEGRATE doesnâ€™t get you, the psychic backlash from MASS + DISINTEGRATE

## No Healing!?

There is no believed to be no healing magic, you heal slowly (in downtime, unless seen by a physician) 

Vampires seem to heal - pull damage onto caster, caster then heals
