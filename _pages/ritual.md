Ritual magic can be used to do ''Anything'', but you need to please the Spirit that you are beseeching, have a number of people helping you, be at a significant place, and time it so the stars are right.

The more factors that you have in your favour the better you chance of success and the more powerful the effect.

You must clense yourself to the spirit and open up a spiritual connection to the spirit you are beseeching.
this clensing must be done at least and hour before the main ritual.

You and your ritual team need to perform a 10 to 15 minute ritual.
How you perform this ritual and what you do it entirely up to you.
You must open the ritual with a calling to the specific spirit, to which you are making your request.

At some point you later the effects of your ritual will become apparent.
