Binders or Shaman can bind spirits to themselves.

Each player will have a known at least 2 Spirit which they can bind. 

Nearly every binder knows of "Kregot, the opener of the ways", for it is the first spirit that they bind to their will.

Each spirit will have differing effects that last until sun-change (dawn or dusk, 6 oâ€™clock) 

Binders of Shaman gain powers based on which chakra points (Head, Heart, Spirit) they are bind the spirit too.

You can only bind one spirit to each chakra point, and you can only ever have a known spirit bound once. 

These spirits are capricious and need plicating, sometimes they require certain rites to be performed before they will be summoned.

Such as: 

* You must mark your forehead with their symbol
* You must have one bare foot in water and one on dry land 
* You must summon them at Dusk or Dawn only


for instance:

### "Kregot, the opener of the ways"

Head: allows you to see invisible things
Heart:  - 
Spirit: - 


### "Lajal, the screaming metal spirit" 


Head: causes binder to go berserk, attacking anyone close by whether friend or foe, until they fall over from exhaustion, are killed, or knocked unconscious. 
Heart: gives +3 armour, which are used up first.
Spirit: gives you one use of RESIST FEAR
* You must mark your forehead with their symbol
