##OOC notes: 
These spirits are often manifest as vaguely humanoid in shape, appearing as both female and male body shapes equally with very specific mask. 

suggested costume - simple black robe/morph suit, with styalised mask, this allows the spirits to be played by varius crew.

* Each Spirit should have a 'how to play' npc sheet
* the mask will only ever be used for that type of spirit, or individual 'named' spirit
